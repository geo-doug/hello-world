# hello-world
This is my first user account on github. I've used it in the past as a guest and have seen how useful it is to fellow researchers.

I want to learn a new language and design products that can improve my everyday life.
Right now, I've got a lot of ideas that incorporate sensory components and hardware/apparel for bikers.
These projects could help improve cyclist safety and visibility on the roadway, reducing confusion with motorists.
